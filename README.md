# Charging Simulation - README

## Overview
This project provides a simulation tool for a shop owner to estimate the total energy consumption and peak power load based on the number of charging points installed, the number of cars arriving for charging, and various parameters related to the charging stations.

The goal is to create an input form for simulation parameters and display the results in an easy-to-understand and visually appealing way.
